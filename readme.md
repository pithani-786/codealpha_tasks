# Basic Chatbot

## Goal
Build a simple **rule-based chatbot** using Python. The chatbot interacts with the user by responding to basic inputs with predefined replies.
---

## Features
- Accepts basic user inputs like:
  - hello
  - how are you
  - what's your name
  - bye
- Responds with:
  - hi!
  - I'm fine, thanks!
  - I'm just a chatbot created by Python
  - Goodbye!

##  Scope
This project is focused on:
- Simple rule-based logic.
- No use of AI or NLP libraries.
- Console-based text input/output.

## Key Concepts Used
- "if", "elif", "else" statements
- "while" loop
- "Functions (def)"
- "input()" and "print()" for interaction
