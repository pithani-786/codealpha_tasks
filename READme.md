#  Task 1: Hangman Game

##  Goal
Create a simple **text-based Hangman game** in Python where the player guesses a hidden word **one letter at a time**.
---
##  Simplified Scope

-  Use a small list of **5 predefined words**  
  (No need to use external files or APIs)
- Limit incorrect guesses to **6**
- Use **basic console input/output**  
  (No graphics or audio)
---
## Key Concepts Used

-random – to randomly select a word from the list  
-while loop – to keep the game running until win/loss  
-if-else – to check correct vs. incorrect guesses  
-strings – for handling the chosen word  
-lists – for storing guessed letters and word progress  

---
## How to Run

1. Open this project folder in **VS Code**
2. Make sure Python is installed ('python --version')
3. Run the game using:
python hangman.py
